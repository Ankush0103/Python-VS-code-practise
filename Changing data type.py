# print(type(a)) # It is STRING NOT INTEGER

# print(a + 5) # 5 is integer so no output

a = (int(a)) # This function converts double quoted number to integer which was previouly sting. It only converts b=numberto int, it will not convert ank to int because ank is string.
print(type(a)) # we use typecasting in above function i.e. converting one data type to aonther data type.
