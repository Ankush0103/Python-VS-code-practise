a = input("Enter your name: ")
print(type(a)) # name: 34 # type(a) = <class 'str'>
# input function allows user to take input from keyword as a string.

b = input("Enter a number: ")
b = (int(b))
print(type(b)) # number written  as 87 and after conversion by int(b) it gives <class 'int'> so by typecasting we can even convert input class.
